# **James' Notes**
### CS260
Here is a link to my [ReadMe File](https://github.com/j1mo3/startup/blob/main/README.md)

I learned a lot about GitHub from the GitHub assignment. I really like it because it allows you to save different
versions of your code. This is both extremely helpful and cool to look back on, and it also saves your code just in case you lose the file hosted on your local computer.

Some of the Git commands I learned include:
1. git pull (gets the current version of your code from github)
2. git commit -am "description-here" (commits your code and adds a description as to what it does)
3. git push ("pushes" your code to GitHub)
Those are just some of the really helpful and interesting commands you can use in VSCode and Github.

I also learned how to work with md (markdown) files! Formatting is really simple. You can use hashtags to change the size, and **double stars** around text you want to make bold!
