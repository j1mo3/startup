# **James' Notes**
### CS260 Notes
Here is a link to my [ReadMe File](https://github.com/j1mo3/startup/blob/main/README.md)

I learned a lot about GitHub from the GitHub assignment. I really like it because it allows you to save different
versions of your code. This is both extremely helpful and cool to look back on, and it also saves your code just in case you lose the file hosted on your local computer.

Some of the Git commands I learned include:
1. git pull (gets the current version of your code from github)
2. git commit -am "description-here" (commits your code and adds a description as to what it does)
3. git push ("pushes" your code to GitHub)
Those are just some of the really helpful and interesting commands you can use in VSCode and Github.

I also learned how to work with md (markdown) files! Formatting is really simple. You can use hashtags to change the size, and **double stars** around text you want to make bold!

# Git

![Git Icon](essentialsGitIcon.png)

[Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), the creator of Linux, was fed up with the proprietary version control software that he was using to track the code for the Linux kernel and so over a weekend he built Git, the world's most popular version control system.

## Installing Git

Before we can talk about Git you need to make sure it is installed in your development environment. Open a console and type `git --version`.

```sh
➜  git --version
git version 2.32.0 (Apple Git-132)
```

If you do not see something like that, then you need to follow these [instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to install Git.

## What is Git?

Git provides two valuable functions. First, it allows you to track versions of files in a directory. Second, it allows you to clone all of those versions to a different location, usually to a different computer. We are going to focus on tracking versions in this instruction and cover cloning repositories when we talk later about GitHub.

You can track file versions of any files in a directory by initializing Git for that directory. You can do this right now by creating a new directory in a console window and initializing it as a Git repository.

```sh
➜  mkdir playingWithGit
➜  cd playingWithGit
➜  git init
```

If you list all files in the directory you will see that you now have a hidden directory named `.git`.

```sh
➜  ls -la
total 0
drwxr-xr-x   3 lee  staff    96 Dec  1 22:59 .
drwxr-xr-x+ 54 lee  staff  1728 Dec  1 23:00 ..
drwxr-xr-x   9 lee  staff   288 Dec  1 22:59 .git
```

The `.git` directory is where all of the versions get stored. Now use the `echo` command to create a file so that we can see how versioning works. After creating the new file, use `git status` to tell you what git is doing.

```sh
➜ echo hello world > hello.txt
➜ git status

On branch master
No commits yet
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
 hello.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

`git status` tells you that it detects a new file named `hello.txt`, but it isn't currently tracking versions for that file. To begin tracking versions you need to add it. Usually you track all files in a repository directory and so you can tell Git to track everything that it doesn't know about with `git add .`. Make sure you include the period at the end of the command. Follow the add command with another call to `git status` in order to see what the repo looks like now.

```sh
➜  git add .
➜  git status

On branch master
No commits yet
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
 new file:   hello.txt
```

Now Git tells us that it has _staged_ the file `hello.txt`, meaning it is ready to be committed as a version in the repository. We commit a version with the `commit` command. We always want to have a meaningful comment about the version we are committing and so we use the `-m` parameter to provide a message that will live with the version. Follow this with another call to `git status`.

```sh
➜  git commit -m "initial draft"
[master (root-commit) d43b07b] initial draft
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 hello.txt

➜  git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Congratulations! You have just committed your first file to a Git repository. It is important to note that we were only working with a single file in this example. However, a commit can represent multiple files. You just need to add them all before you execute the commit. Also, note that the point of the stage, `git add` step, is so that you can commit some files while still leaving other modified files out of the commit. Only files you've staged will be committed.

Let's make an edit to our file and commit it again. This time we will tell Git that we want to add all the modified tracked files to our commit, without having to `git add` them again, by including the `-a` parameter along with our message parameter.

```sh
➜  echo goodbye world > hello.txt

➜  git commit -am "changed greeting to reflect the present mood"

[master e65f983] changed greeting to reflect the present mood
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

Now that we have a couple versions in our repository we can view the versions with the `git log` command.

```sh
➜  git log

commit e65f9833ca8ee366d0d9c1676a91b1a977dab441 (HEAD -> master)
Author: Lee
Date:   Thu Dec 1 23:32:22 2022 -0700

    changed greeting to reflect the present mood

commit d43b07b8890f52defb31507211ba78785bf6dccf
Author: Lee
Date:   Thu Dec 1 23:29:11 2022 -0700

    initial draft
```

This shows both commits with the associated comments.

## Commit SHA

Every commit has a unique identifier that is generated by hashing the file along with the timestamp using the SHA hashing algorithm. You can always refer to a specific commit in your version history by using its SHA. For example, if we want to temporarily switch back to a previous version to see what it contains we can use the `checkout` command. You only need to provide the first few characters of the SHA.

```sh
➜  git checkout d43b07b8890f

Note: switching to 'd43b07b8890f'.
HEAD is now at d43b07b initial draft

➜  cat hello.txt
hello world
```

The above output omits a big message saying that you are no longer looking at the latest version, but the important thing is that you can see that we are now looking at our old version. Note that you don't want to make commits at this point since it will create a branch that is not for the latest code. To get back to the top of the version chain, use the `checkout` command and reference the branch name, which is by default `master`.

```sh
➜  git checkout master
Previous HEAD position was d43b07b initial draft
Switched to branch 'master'

➜  cat hello.txt
goodbye world
```

Now we are back to our latest version.

The following diagram shows how your commits move from your working directory, to staging them for a commit, and then committing them to a repository.

![Git stage](essentialsGitStage.jpg)

A commit is a full snapshot of what was staged from your directory at the time of the commit. That means all of the files contained in the commit were reverted when you executed the checkout command. Since we only had one file in our commit, it looks like we are only flipping that file around, but basically you can think of it as a time machine for the entire directory.

## Diff

Most of the time you don't want to reverse back to an earlier commit. Instead you just want to compare the differences between commits. We can do that with the `diff` command. You can specify two SHAs that you would like to compare, or you can use the `HEAD` variable, which always points to the commit you're currently looking at. To refer to earlier commits you just add `~` and the numerical distance from `HEAD` that you want to reference. In this case we will compare `HEAD` and `HEAD~1`.

```sh
➜  git diff HEAD HEAD~1
```

```diff
diff --git a/hello.txt b/hello.txt
index 3b18e51..eeee2af 100644
--- a/hello.txt
+++ b/hello.txt
@@ -1 +1 @@
-hello world
+goodbye world
```

You can see that we made a change to `hello.txt` by removing `hello world` and adding `goodbye world`.

## Branches

Git supports the ability to branch your code. This allows you to work on variations of the code while still allowing progress on the main branch. For example, if you wanted to work on a new feature named `A` without interrupting work on the master branch, you would use the `git branch A` command to create a new branch named `A`, then start working on the new branch with the `git checkout A` command. Now commits can be done to either the `master` branch or the `A` branch. When you want to combine the work done on both branches, you checkout the `master` branch and execute `git merge A`. If you decide you want to abandon the new feature, then you just don't ever merge it back into the master branch.

Here is a demonstration of this working on the visualization tool provided by [git-school.github.io](https://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/).

![Branches](essentialsBranching.gif)

## Commit often

You will be required to have at least ten commits for each project that you submit in order to get full credit. Commonly, this will be an initial commit that contains empty project files, followed by commits at each functional milestone, and then a final commit for the working project. Committing your code often is an important practice for you to develop. It protects you from losing your work, allows access from anywhere, makes it so you can quickly share changes, reduces conflicts with your peers, and enables you to efficiently explore different possibilities. This also enables others to review the progression of your development efforts in order to prove the originality of your work.

Remember to make meaningful commit messages that describe the **what** and **why** of the changes made. Here is a [good post](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/) on how to make meaningful commit messages.

## Binary files

You can store any type of file in Git, but be aware that if you store large binary files, such as images or videos, you are storing a copy of that file each time you make a change to it. For example, suppose you use Git to track the changes you make to a video production project. Every time you save a change to your 10 GB video file you store a complete copy of the file. That means 10 commits of the video file will store 100 GB of data in your repository.

## VS Code and Git

Knowing how to use Git from the console is a very valuable skill. Git offers a wide variety of functionality such as creating branches of the repository, temporarily stashing changes, and cloning repositories to other machines.

However, by using a tool like VS Code you can hide all of the complexity of the command line and use a visual interface instead.

Here we see VS Code, with the GitLens extension installed, looking at the directory we have been working in. On the left you see all the commits we have previously created. We can edit our `hello.txt` file and VS Code will automatically detect the change and set it up for us to commit. VS Code will even put a marking on the left side of the edited text to show us what line we have changed. We can click on the staged file, in the commit area, and see the differences before we commit. Since they look good, we add a comment, and press commit. The new commit immediately shows up in our list of commits. We can use the visual diff again to click through all of the previous versions.

![VS Code Git](essentialsVSCodeGit.gif)

Underneath the covers, the GitLens extension is running Git commands just like we did on the command line, but using a visual tool makes working with versions much easier. Take some time and play with adding files, modifying them, committing, and diffing. You want to get to the point where this is second nature so that you can easily experiment and make mistakes, knowing that with Git, you can always easily recover.

# GitHub

![GitHub logo](essentialsGitHubLogo.png)

🔑 **Required reading**:

- [GitHub create a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo)
- [GitHub cloning a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
- [GitHub personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)

When we introduced `Git`, we said that Git provides two things, 1) Version tracking in a repository, and 2) the ability to clone a copy of the repository to a different location. You can clone repositories between computers used by your development team, but the management of cloning repositories is much easier when you use a cloud based service such as `GitHub`.

GitHub was launched in 2008 by a small group of developers that wanted to make code collaboration easy. GitHub was acquired by Microsoft in 2018 for $7.5 billion. Since its beginning as a simple web application for cloning and storing Git repositories, GitHub has added functionality for hosting websites, supporting community pull requests, tracking issues, hosting codespaces, running continuous deployment processes, managing projects, and even AI driven code generation.

We are going to use GitHub for three things.

1. Hosting all of this instruction. Because it is hosted on GitHub you can generate pull requests when you see things that need improvement.
1. Publicly hosting your project repositories. This creates a backup copy of your code, demonstrates your progress with your commit history, allows for reviews of your code, and makes it so you can collaborate with your peers. It also looks good on a resume!
1. Keeping notes about what you have learned and things you want to remember.

## Creating a GitHub account

If you do not already have a GitHub account then go and [create one now](https://github.com). GitHub provides a free version of their services that will more than cover your usage in this class. Chances are that once you start using GitHub you will use this account for many years to come, both for personal and professional projects.

## Creating and cloning a repository

While you can create a repository in your development environment using `git init` and then connect it to an upstream repository on GitHub, it is always easier to create your repository first on GitHub and then clone it to your development environment. That way your local repository and your GitHub repository are automatically linked to each other.

To create a repository in GitHub, log into your account, select the `Repositories` tab, and press `New repository`. You then specify a unique repository name, give a description, indicate that you want it to be public, add a default README.md file, and choose a license.

![GitHub create repository](essentialsGitHubCreateRepo.jpg)

Every repository in GitHub has a unique URL assigned to it. Assuming the repository is public, anyone with the URL can clone it to their development environment. A repository clone is an exact copy of the repository including all of the commits, comments, and SHAs. It also configures the clone to know what the remote source is so that you can use Git commands to keep them in sync as changes are made. In this case, the remote source is the GitHub repository.

![GitHub clone](essentialsGitHubClone.jpg)

You clone a repository by providing the GitHub repository's URL as a parameter to the `git clone` command from in a console window. You can get a copy of the URL from the repository's GitHub page and clicking on the green `Code` button, and then clicking on the copy button next to the HTTPS URL.

![GitHub clone URL](essentialsGitUrlButton.jpg)

When you clone a repository it is placed in a subdirectory named with the name of the repository. So make sure you are in the directory where you keep all of your source repositories before you run the command.

```sh
➜  git clone https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example.git

Cloning into 'startup-example'...
remote: Total 4 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (4/4), done.

➜  cd startup-example
```

## Making changes

You can now make changes to the files in the repository and commit those changes. As you create new commits on your local clone, you want to push those changes back up to the GitHub clone of the repository so that the repositories are in sync with each other. This is done with the `push` Git command. Once you have pushed the new commits then your peers who have cloned the repository can pull the commits down using the `pull` Git command.

![GitHub pull](essentialsGitHubPull.jpg)

The following demonstrates console commands for making a change to a `test.md` file, committing it, and then pushing it up to GitHub. Of course you can also do this using the Git interface of VS Code.

```sh
➜  printf "\nChange from my development environment!\n" >> test.md

➜  git add test.md

➜  git commit -am "update(notes) thoughts about startup applications"

➜  git push
```

This is the pattern that you want to make a reflexive part of your development process.

1. Pull the repository's latest changes from GitHub (`git pull`)
1. Make changes to the code
1. Commit the changes (`git commit`)
1. Push the changes to GitHub (`git push`)

⚠ Note: The first time you make a push request to a repository Git will ask you how you want to identify yourself and what credential (e.g. password) to use in order to authenticate with GitHub. You will need to create a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) and provide that as your password.

```sh
*** Please tell me who you are

Run
  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your name"
```

Make sure you use the email that you provided for your GitHub account.

After pushing changes to GitHub, you can then view the changes on GitHub with your browser. In the example above, you would see the changes to the `test.md` file. You can also edit and commit changes directly from GitHub. When looking at a repository file on GitHub you will see a little pencil in the top right hand corner of the file. If you press that you will enter edit mode. You use that to modify the file and then commit the changes with an appropriate comment.

![GitHub edit](essentialsGitHubEdit.jpg)

Now there is a commit that GitHub has, but you do not have in your development environment. If we run the `fetch` Git command, you will get the latest information about the changes on GitHub without actually changing your local repository. We then run the `status` Git command to see the differences between the clones and see that we are missing a commit. You can pull it down using the `pull` Git command. You can also use the Git functionality in VS Code to view the status and sync up your repository.

```sh
➜  git fetch
➜  git status
Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)

➜  git pull
Updating d13a9ce..cafe81a
Fast-forward
 test.md | 4 +++-
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

After running the pull command, your development clone and the GitHub clone are now the same.

## Handling merge conflicts

By pushing and pulling often, everyone keeps an up to date copy of the repository. This is important so that you don't run into merging problems caused by two peers modifying the exact same code. Merging only becomes something you have to deal with when two people modify the exact same line of code. However, when you have two peers working together you are always going to have a merge conflict at some point in time and so let's discuss how to handle this.

We can simulate a merge conflict by editing a line in a file and committing the file in your development environment, and before pushing that change, modifying the same line using GitHub. Now, run `fetch` and `status` again in your console.

```sh
➜  git fetch
➜  git status
Your branch and 'origin/main' have diverged,
and have 1 and 1 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)
```

This shows that the cloned repositories have diverged from each other. Normally this is fine and we can just push and pull the different commits, but if we do that this time, we will get an error because the exact same line was changed in the two different commits. Git doesn't know which change to keep.

```sh
➜  git pull

Auto-merging test.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in test.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

We now need to resolve the merge conflict that it says has happened with our `test.md` file. If you are using VS Code with the GitLens extension installed it will visually walk you through this process. However, so you can understand what is going on, we will do this using the console. The first step is to open up `test.md` in an editor. You will see that git has injected lines that highlight where the conflict is. Both your local change and the change made on GitHub are included.

```diff
An example startup application

Change from my development environment!

Change from GitHub

<<<<< HEAD
Conflict change made in development environment
=======
Conflict change made in GitHub
>>>>> b9f4c53c91eff509993d7291e60148f903827de0
```

We resolve the conflict by modifying the file to remove the textual conflict delimiters and modifying the file to keep the changes we want. When we are done editing, our file contains what we want from both commits.

```md
# startup-example

An example startup application

Change from my development environment and from GitHub
```

Now that the conflict is resolved we commit our resolution and push up the result.

```sh
➜  git commit -am "merge(notes) combined both edits"
➜  git push
```

If you go look at the file again on GitHub you will see the additional commit in the history and the result of our merge in the file content.

## README.md

Keeping notes of what you have learned and things that you want to remember is an essential step for accelerating your web programming skills. GitHub supports the inclusion of a file with the special name `README.md` in the root of your repository. The `README.md` file is displayed in GitHub when you view your repository. This file uses `Markdown` syntax. If you have not used Markdown before, then take some time to [learn how to use it](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). For this course you will use your startup application's `README.md` file to describe the modifications and alterations that you make to your startup.

You will also create another Markdown file named `notes.md` to track what you have learned in the course. You can use anything that you put in your `notes.md` file when taking the midterm or final.

## Forks

A GitHub fork provides the ability to create a copy of a GitHub repository. Usually you [fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) to get a copy of an open source code base that you want to experiment with, or contribute to. For example, the repository containing these instructions. A fork is similar to cloning a repository to your development environment, but it clones to GitHub instead. Then pull the fork down to your development environment to work on it. The fork maintains a link to the upstream (original) repository that allows you to easily pull down updates and merge them with your fork. A fork also allows you to create a pull request in order to push suggested changes to the original repository.

If you have never forked a repository before you should go find an open source project that interests you. For example, here is the [Dad Jokes API](https://github.com/DadJokes-io/Dad_Jokes_API). This simple web service provides an endpoint to get a joke. Consider forking this repository in order to experiment with how it works. Don't worry too much about what the code is doing. That will make more sense as the class goes on.

![GitHub fork](essentialsGitHubFork.jpg)

It would be awesome if we can increase the fork count for `Dad Jokes API` into the hundreds. Also make sure you push the `Star` button to show that you like the repo. Let's blow KegenGuyll's mind!

## Pull requests

📖 **Deeper dive reading**:

- [GitHub Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
- [GitHub pulls from forks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

GitHub allows you to create a fork of any repository on GitHub. You just push the `Fork` button from the repository's GitHub page. You can then make modifications to the repository fork and push the changes as a _pull request_. This notifies the original repository's owner that a request is being made to enhance the original repository. The owner can review your changes and if appropriate commit the changes into the original. This is how open source communities manage development from a volunteer group of global developers.

# A brief history of web programming

Having a basic knowledge of the history of web programming helps you to understand why we have the assortment of technologies that you will be working with. There has been three distinct phases that make up this history.

1. The formation of the internet that supports the communication of web applications
1. The creation of HTML and HTTP that made it possible to shared hyperlinked documents (Web 1.0).
1. The creation of CSS and JavaScript that enabled interactive web applications (Web 2.0).

## The Internet

The essential first step to enabling what we now call web programming was the formation of a global communications network that was reliable and publicly available. This was made possible when the United States Department of Defense created the ARPANET as a means of sharing information between universities doing defense related research.

![Arpanet](arpanet1970s.jpg)

— ARPANET access points in the 1970s (**Source**: _Wikipedia_)

ARPANET was defined with the goal of withstanding a nuclear attack. This led to the implementation of a redundantly connected graph of computing devices. Within that network, two computers communicate by dynamically discovering a path to each other without the help of a single central authority.

In the 1980s, the National Science Foundation continued the expansion of the network, and commercial enterprises began to make significant contributions. This eventually led to the Internet as we know it today, as the world went online as part of a massive explosion of consumer participation in the early 1990s. This was followed by another exponential increase in the 2000s as smart phones and appliances became common.

The management of the Internet is controlled by two major organizations. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) defines the technical standards that specify how the physical network communicates. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) oversees both the Internet Protocol ([IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol)) address space, and the Domain Name System ([DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System)). These two databases form the address book of the Internet. When the United States government transitioned control of these governing bodies to a global community of non-profit stake holders in 2016, the Internet became a worldwide asset free from any specific political control.

## Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)

![Tim Berners Lee](timBernersLee.jpg)

> “I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the TCP and DNS ideas and—ta-da!—the World Wide Web.”
>
> — Tim Berners-Lee, (**Source**: _Answers for Young People_)

Starting in 1980, Tim Berners-Lee was working at the research laboratory Cern. He was tasked with building a system that would allow researchers to share documents between remote academic institutions. Realizing that the ARPANET provided the necessary connectivity, he defined the protocols for document sharing that formed the underpinning of what would be termed the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee named the document format the HyperText Markup Language ([HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)) based on inspiration from the digital publishing industry's Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML). One of the key innovations of HTML was the idea that documents could be interconnected with what he termed hyperlinks to allow immediate access to related documents. In 1990 he put all the pieces together and built the world's first web server on his desktop NeXT computer. You can visit a reproduction of the first web site at [info.cern.ch](http://info.cern.ch/).

![First web server](firstWebServer.jpg)

— First web server (**Source**: _Cern_)

Originally, HTML contained only 18 elements, or tags. The latest version of HTML has now grown to over 100. The initial explosion of elements was caused in part by browser vendors racing to create differentiating functionality in order to gain market share. Since 1996 the HTML specification has been controlled by the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/). The following is an example of a simple HTML document.

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <p>Hello world!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## HTTP and URL

While HTML was an incredible step forward, Berners-Lee also made other significant contributions. This included the definition of the HyperText Transfer Protocol ([HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)) and the Uniform Resource Locator ([URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL)). These two definitions specify how web documents are addressed and transmitted across the Internet. The following gives an example of a URL and HTTP request.

```http
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Helping.html
```

```http
GET /hypertext/WWW/Helping.html HTTP/1.1
Host: info.cern.ch
Accept: text/html
```

## Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

Cascading Style Sheets ([CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)) was first proposed in 1994 by Håkon Wium Lie, a contemporary of Berners-Lee at CERN, in order to give HTML documents visual styling independent of the content's structure. Before the introduction of CSS, HTML was going down the path of hard coding the visual appearance of the content with HTML elements. This would have resulted in a single visual style for the entire web that was completely defined by the browser vendors.

![Hakon Lie](hakonLie.jpg)

> “If we hadn’t developed CSS, we could have ended up with the web being a giant fax machine”
>
> — Håkon Wium Lie (**Source**: _Medium.com_)

By 1996, CSS became a standard and all the major browsers began to implement the functionality. Unfortunately, for the first years of CSS the same proprietary wars that plagued HTML also affected CSS. Much of the work on version 2.1 was to remove error and make all the features of CSS compatible. Here is a simple example of CSS that defines the white spacing, color, and shadowing of paragraph text.

```css
p {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 20px 0;
  color: #00539f;

The ability of CSS to style a web page has increased significantly from its original implementation. With modern CSS a web programmer can import fonts, animate HTML elements, respond to user actions, and dynamically alter the entire layout of the page based on the size of a device and its orientation.

## JavaScript

In 1995 Netscape (the maker of the popular browser Navigator) decided to add the ability to script web pages. The initial implementation was led by Brendan Eich and given the name JavaScript. JavaScript turned the previously static web into an interactive experience where a web page could dynamically change based upon a user's interaction.

In 1996 Netscape turned control of JavaScript over to ECMA International in an attempt to standardize the definition of the language. At that point JavaScript officially became know as ECMAScript, although it is still commonly referred to as JavaScript.

Here is an example of a simple JavaScript program that combines variables and prints out the result.

```js
const join = (...a) => {
  return a.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue);
};

console.log(join(1, 2));
console.log(join('hello', ' ', 'world', '!'));
```

The first decade of JavaScript was turbulent as each of the major browser vendors attempted to introduce new proprietary features in order to gain market share. Eventually in 2009 the major vendors agreed on the ECMAScript 5 standard and in 2015 ECMAScript 6 was released as the last major feature upgrade. Since then minor releases have taken the year of their release as their version number.

### JavaScript outside the browser

In 2009 Ryan Dahl created Node.js as the first successful application for deploying JavaScript outside of a browser. This changed the mindset of JavaScript as purely a browser technology to one that is leveraged across an entire technology stack.

Other important milestones in the history of JavaScript include the 2013 standardization of the common object notation JSON, a typed variant named TypeScript in 2012, and the introduction of numerous transpilers for converting other languages into compatible ECMAScript.
